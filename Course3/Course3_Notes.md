#### iv. Interview with Tristan Kromer, Lean Startup Coach:
   1. Our minds are biased against testing our own hypothesis, especially for entrepreneurs who are looking to think big and change the world.
   2. Lean Startup: Learn to doubt yourself, you have to test and validate your assumptions and ideas.
   3. To think big and to simultaneously test all your ideas/assumptions involves a certain amount of cognitive dissonance.
   4. You have to do the process of testing with your whole team. 
   5. The basic philosophy of a startup is that we are creating knowledge of a new business model.
   6. You have a goal and you are moving in a systematic fashion.
   7. You build a culture of experimentation.

#### iv. Interview with David Bland, Founder of Precoil and longtime Agile & Lean Practitioner:
   1. **Strong beliefs but held loosely** is the personality that works best in Lean Startups/Agile. You have a vision, but you are ready to be influences by data: qualitative or quantitative.
   2. Cross-Functional team of designers, engineering, and product together is necessary. Further, the teams need to be dedicated and focussed on the product at hand.
   3. Leaders have to lead with questions, foster a culture of learning, and let bring the team bring in their passion, instead of Leader imposing and saying I know best.
