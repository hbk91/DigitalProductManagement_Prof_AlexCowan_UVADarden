   3. Manage Work in Progress
   4. Define and Communicate Release Content

#### c. Building:
   1. Code Creation and Maintenance
   2. Version Control and Integration
   3. Maintain Best Practices Architectures and Conventions
   4. Functional Testing

#### d. Managing:
   1. Team Management
   2. Interface to General Management

### v. Scrum: Three roles:
   1. Scrum Master/Agile Coach
   2. Product Owner
   3. Development Team

### vi. XP(Extreme Programming): 4 core values:
   1. Communication
   2. Simplicity
   3. Feedback
   4. Courage

### vii. Kanban:
   Unlike XP or Scrum, Kanban is not STLC( Software Total Life Cycle). However, it is valuable in managing flow. It was originally invented to improve assembly lines. Kanban's six principles are:
   1. Visualize Workflow
   2. Limit Work in Progress
   3. Manage Flows: That ideas and jobs are moving seamlessly
   4. Be explicit
   5. Implement Feedback Loops
   6. Improve Collaboratively and Evolve Experimentally
