## A. Week1: Problem Agile Solves:

   1. This course is focused on how we get better inputs in the process. Amazon famously releases every 11.6 seconds.
   2. You can't project manage your way. There is an interdisciplinary team and collaboration is the key. An interdisciplinary team comprising of Designers, Engineering & QA, Sales and Support, Project Manager, Product Manager, Data Analytics team, others. Create small, self-organizing, interdisciplinary teams.
   3. Focus on the following:
      1. The individual with testable narratives
      2. Frontload Value.
      3. Outcomes vs Output.
   4. Agile Manifesto:
      1. **Individual and Interactions** over processes and tools
      2. **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
      3. **Customer Collaboration** over contract Negotiation.
      4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.
   5. **Agile for Managers:**
      1. Establish Project Charters.
      2. Develop easy to use test plans to test usability.
   6. **Agile for Specialists:**
      1. Developer:
         1. Learn the actual narrative what the end-user is trying to achieve with a particular feature.
         2. After the release, ask the right questions. Did the user like it? If they didn't, why didn't they like it?
      2. Sales:
         1. Learn how to talk to the rest of the team.
         2. Give his inputs in more actionable way.
      3. Designer:
         1. Life of product is complicated. It has to be marketed, sold, supported, serviced, maintained after release. Hence, designers should be mindful of these considerations as well while designing a product.
         2. Bring your design thinking to others and help engineering, product managers, project managers, sales to use design tools in practical ways to solve problems.
   7. **Agile Story**:
      1. As a **persona**, I want to **do something**, so that I can **derive a reward**. Example: "As a social mom, I want to see if anyone like my Facebook post, so I can decide if I want to go back and look at the post". So the notification from the App/text/email indicating that the post has been liked could have been developed for such a user story.
   8. Three prominent Agile Methodologies:
      1. **Scrum:** One of the most prevalent agile methodologies.
      2. **Extreme Programming (XP):** More focused on coding methodologies extended to Project Management practices. 
      3. **Kanban:** Set of techniques to reduce Work-in-Progress (WIP).
   9. **What makes Agile Hard:**
      1.  Doing precisely what the user asks _- Wrong Approach_
      2.  Assuming you know the best and ignore the user _- Wrong Approach_

   10. **Instrumenting Observation** is critical
   11. **TDD: Test-driven Development**
   12. **XP: Extreme Programming**


## B. Week2: Focusing your Agile with Personas, Jobs-to-be-Done, and Alternatives:

   1. Good Personas should be **VARIED**.
      1. Vivid
      2. Actionable
      3. Real
      4. Identifiable
      5. Exact
      6. Detailed
   2. Apply **Think, See, Feel, Do** framework for personas.
   3. Problem Scenarios => Epic Stories => Child Stories => Test Cases
   4. A Story outline: As a **Persona**, I want to **do something**, so that I can **realize a reward.** 

## C. Week3: Getting to Great Agile User Stories:

   #### **Persona Hypothesis:**

   | Question Type | Questions |
   | :---          | :---      |     
   | Tell me about yourself/in this role | Tell me about being a Technician? How did you get this job? What do you most/least like about it? What about the job is hard/easy? I have head [x], does that apply to you |
   | Tell me about your area of interest | Would you say you have a specialty/a particular kind of job you like to do? |
  

## D. Week4: Focusing on Customer Value with User Stories:
