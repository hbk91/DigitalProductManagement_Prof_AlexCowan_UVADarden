## Week1: Achieving Focus & Winning:

#### 1. Three objectives of a Product Manager:
   1. Identify Product-market fit Hypothesis that are relevant to the user and testable
   2. Bringing those ideas into the Product Pipeline
   3. Facilitate alignment b/w companies vision and the team's purpose

#### 2. Product Manager:
   1. User Experience-Tech-Business
   2. Designer-Hacker-Hustler (H2D)
   3. Desirability-Feasibility-Viability

#### 3. Product Manager:
   1. Quite often, Product Managers get in the trap of Feasibility and Viability. This often leads to failure
   2. Desirability is the independent variable. Find the right problems and iterate to the solution to achieve desirability. That is what good Product Managers do.
   3. Before iPod came along, there were several mp3 players that did a decent job. However, iPod solved a critical pain point. Loading music into mp3 players was a painful experience via third-party softwares etc. iPod made that process smooth via iTunes and iTunes store and thus became the market leader.
   4. Go from Scale Friendly to Innovation Friendly. Move from Waterfall structure to Agile structure
   5. Three most important things for PM are=> Identifying Product-Market Fit, Testing those hypothesis with your inter-disciplinary team, and facilitating alignment with external stakeholders

#### 4. Identifying Product-Market Fit:
   1. It is broken into two components => Finding the Right Problem and Finding the Right Solution
   2. Right Problem: Persona Hypothesis => Job to be Done Hypothesis => Demand Hypothesis
   3. Right Solution: Demand Hypothesis=>Usability Hypothesis

#### 5. Product Pipeline:
   1. **Product Priorities**->Continuous Design->Application Development->Continuous Delivery->**Released Product**>Hypothesis Testing->**Product Priorities**
   2. More specifically the above process is: **Product Priorities**->Ideas->Design->Code/Execution->Tests->Deployment->**Released Product**->Experimental Design->Observations->Inferences->**Product Priorities**
   3. Ensure both high Alignment (with Company's objectives) and high Autonomy within the team  (Spotify's mantra for its engineering team)
   4. Any user interacts with the product in the following way: Plan (Reflective)->Specify (Behavioral)->Perform (Visceral). The the user gives the feedback in the following way: Perceive (Visceral) -> Interpret (Behavioral) -> Compare (Reflective) 
   5. Usability => Prototypes (Balsamiq) => App Analytics => Usability Testing
   6. DevOps => Testing & Deployment
   7.
